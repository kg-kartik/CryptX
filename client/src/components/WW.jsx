        My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 1701 Mountain Road NW,
        Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. To all law enforcement entities, this is
        not an admission of guilt. I am speaking to my family now. Skyler, you
        are the love of my life. I hope you know that. Walter Jr., you're my big
        man. There are going to be some things that you'll come to learn about
        me in the next few days. But just know that no matter how it may look, I
        only had you in my heart. Goodbye.
